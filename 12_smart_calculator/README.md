This is the 12th project completed by me from [JetBrains Python Developer track.](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/2)

Smart Calculator -- coded a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to remember your previous calculations. Extensively used lists, strings and dictionaries. Also got some experience with 2 important data structures: the stack and the queue.    

An example of the script execution:  
```
> 8
8
> -2 + 4 - 5 + 6
3
> 9 +++ 10 -- 8
27
> 3 --- 5
-2
> 14       -   12
2
> /exit
Bye!
```


The code was created using Python 3.8  
If your machine has an installed Python 3, you can run the code in terminal(command line):  
$ python3 calculator.py
