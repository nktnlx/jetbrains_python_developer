This is the 8th project completed by me from [JetBrains Python Developer track.](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/2)

Numeric Matrix Processor -- how to read and output matrices, do operations on them, and compute the determinant of a square matrix.    

An example of the script execution:  
```
3 3

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

3

3 6 9
12 15 18
21 24 27
```


The code was created using Python 3.8  
If your machine has an installed Python 3, you can run the code in terminal(command line):  
$ python3 processor.py
