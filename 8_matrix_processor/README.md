This is the 8th project completed by me from [JetBrains Python Developer track.](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/2)

Numeric Matrix Processor -- how to read and output matrices, do operations on them, and compute the determinant of a square matrix.    

An example of the script execution:  
```
1. Add matrices
2. Multiply matrix by a constant
3. Multiply matrices
4. Transpose matrix
5. Calculate a determinant
0. Exit
Your choice: 2
Enter size of matrix: 3 3
Enter matrix:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
Enter constant: .5
The result is:
0.5 1.0 1.5
2.0 2.5 3.0
3.5 4.0 4.5

1. Add matrices
2. Multiply matrix by a constant
3. Multiply matrices
4. Transpose matrix
5. Calculate a determinant
0. Exit
Your choice: 3
Enter size of first matrix: 3 2
Enter first matrix:
1 2
3 4
5 6
Enter size of second matrix: 2 4
Enter second matrix:
1 2 3 4
4 3 2 1
The result is:
9.0 8.0 7.0 6.0
19.0 18.0 17.0 16.0
29.0 28.0 27.0 26.0

1. Add matrices
2. Multiply matrix by a constant
3. Multiply matrices
4. Transpose matrix
5. Calculate a determinant
0. Exit
Your choice: 1
Enter size of first matrix: 3 3
Enter first matrix:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
Enter size of second matrix: 2 2
Enter second matrix:
1 2
3 4
The operation cannot be performed.

The code was created using Python 3.8  
If your machine has an installed Python 3, you can run the code in terminal(command line):  
$ python3 processor.py
