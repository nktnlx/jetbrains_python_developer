This is the 8th project completed by me from [JetBrains Python Developer track.](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/2)

Numeric Matrix Processor -- how to read and output matrices, do operations on them, and compute the determinant of a square matrix.    

An example of the script execution:  
```
4 5
1 2 3 4 5
3 2 3 2 1
8 0 9 9 1
1 3 4 5 6

4 5
1 1 4 4 5
4 4 5 7 8
1 2 3 9 8
1 0 0 0 1

2 3 7 8 10
7 6 8 9 9
9 2 12 18 9
2 3 4 5 7
```


The code was created using Python 3.8  
If your machine has an installed Python 3, you can run the code in terminal(command line):  
$ python3 processor.py
