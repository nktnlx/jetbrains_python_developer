This is the second project completed by me from JetBrains Python Developer track: https://hyperskill.org/tracks/2

The code prints some ASCII art based on your choice:  
0 - for dromedary camel,  
1 - for rampant lion,  
2 - for fallow deer,  
3 - for wild goose,  
4 - for silky bat,  
5 - for fluffy rabbit  

You can exit the script by typing in EXIT (case insensitive).   


The code was created using Python 3.8  
If your machine has an installed Python 3, you can run the code in terminal(command line) by typing:   
$ python3 zookeeper.py
