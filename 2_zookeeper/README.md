This is the second project completed by me from JetBrains Python Developer track: https://hyperskill.org/tracks/2

The code prints some ASCII art based on your choice:  
0 - for dromedary camel,  
1 - for rampant lion,  
2 - for fallow deer,  
3 - for wild goose,  
4 - for silky bat,  
5 - for fluffy rabbit  

You can exit the script by typing in EXIT (case insensitive).   

A sample output of running the script is below:  
```
Good day and welcome to our virtual Zoo!
Pick an animal you'd like to see.
Press:
0 - for dromedary camel,
1 - for rampant lion,
2 - for fallow deer,
3 - for wild goose,
4 - for silky bat,
5 - for fluffy rabbit

Type in EXIT if you are too tired with animals wathcing and want to leave.

It looks like this bat is fine.
