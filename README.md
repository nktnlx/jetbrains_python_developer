Hi there!


I'm intensively learning to code and interested in data science, aiming to be hired by the end of 2020.  
This repository is for completed projects from [JetBrains Python Developer track.](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/2)  

List of projects:
1. Chatty Bot -- friendly asks you a bunch of questions, interacts with your input.  
2. Zookeeper -- prints some ASCII art based on your choice.   
3. Credit Calculator -- calculates annuity or differentiate monthly payments, periods to repay a credit, overpayment and a credit principal based on the user input.    
4. Hangman --  is a popular puzzle game. In this version of the game computer hides a word from you and you're trying to guess it letter by letter.  
5. Tic-Tac-Toe -- is a popular pen and pencil game, also known as Xs and Os. This version of the game is for two players. Players set 'X' or 'O' one after another until one of the players have a straight line (including diagonals). If all cells in a 3x3 field are occupied and no one got a straigft line - it is a tie!  
6. Coffee Machine -- the project emulates an operation of a coffee machine. During the project I've practiced working with functions, loops and conditions. Also there was an intro to OOP, including: classes, instances, methods, attributes and magic methods.  
7. Rock-Paper-Scissors -- a playable Rock-Paper-Scissors game, with a Player vs Computer mode. Practiced use of arrays, the random library, formatted strings, and algorithms.  
8. Numeric Matrix Processor -- how to read and output matrices, do operations on them (add, multiply, multiply by a constant, transponse), compute the determinant of a square matrix and its inverse. Practised recursion, nested lists and indexing. 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding skills or will be just fun for you to play with.
