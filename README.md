Hi there!


I'm intensively learning to code and aiming to be hired by the end of 2020.
This repository is for completed projects from JetBrains Python Developer track: https://hyperskill.org/tracks/2
Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding skills or will be just helpful for you under your circumstances.
