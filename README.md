Hi there!


I'm intensively learning to code and interested in data science, aiming to be hired by the end of 2020.  
This repository is for completed projects from JetBrains Python Developer track: https://hyperskill.org/tracks/2  

List of projects:
1. Chatty Bot -- friendly asks you a bunch of questions, interacts with your input.  
2. Zookeeper -- prints some ASCII art based on your choice.   
3. Credit Calculator --  
4. Hangman --  

Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding skills or will be just fun for you to play with.
