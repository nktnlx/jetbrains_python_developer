This is the 1st project completed by me from [JetBrains Natural Language Processing track.](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/10)

Honest Calculator -- working on the project, you're at first required to build a simple calculator which later on is going to motivate users to try and do the math themselves by becoming more and more honest with them.   

An example of the script execution:  
```
Enter an equation
2 + 3
You are ... lazy
5.0
Do you want to store the result? (y / n):
y
Are you sure? It is only one digit! (y / n)
y
Don't be silly, it's just one number! Add to the memory? (y / n)
n
Do you want to continue calculations? (y / n):
y
Enter an equation
5 + M
You are ... lazy ... very, very lazy
5.0
Do you want to store the result? (y / n):
y
Are you sure? It is only one digit! (y / n)
y
Don't be silly, it's just one number! Add to memory? (y / n)
y
Last chance! Do you really want to embarrass yourself? (y / n)
y
Do you want to continue calculations? (y / n):
y
Enter an equation
M / M
You are ... lazy
1.0
Do you want to store the result? (y / n):
n
Do you want to continue calculations? (y / n):
n
```  

The code implements the flowchart below:

The code was created using Python 3.8  
If your machine has an installed Python 3, you can run the code in terminal(command line):  
$ python3 honest_calc.py
