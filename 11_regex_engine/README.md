This is the 11th project completed by me from [JetBrains Python Developer track.](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/2)

Regex Engine -- In this project, you will write an extendable regex engine that can handle basic regex syntax, including literals (a, b, c, etc.), wild-cards (.), and metacharacters (?, +, ^, $). Learned about the regex syntax, practiced working with parsing and slicing, and got more familiar with boolean algebra and recursion.   

An example of the script execution:  
```
Input: 'apple|apple'     Output: True
Input: '.pple|apple'     Output: True
Input: 'appl.|apple'     Output: True
Input: '.....|apple'     Output: True
Input: 'peach|apple'     Output: False

```


The code was created using Python 3.8  
If your machine has an installed Python 3, you can run the code in terminal(command line):  
$ python3 regex.py
