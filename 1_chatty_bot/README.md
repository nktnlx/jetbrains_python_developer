This is the very first project completed by me from JetBrains Python Developer track: https://hyperskill.org/tracks/2

The bot does the following simple tasks:  
- greets you;  
- asks your name;  
- calculates your age using math magic;  
- counts numbers from ZERO to an INPUT number;  
- gives your a multiple-choice question about Python;  
- says good bye ..and misses you a lot!     
- a sample output of running the script is below:  
```
