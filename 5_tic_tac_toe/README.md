This is the forth project completed by me from [JetBrains Python Developer track.](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/2)

Tic-Tac-Toe -- is a popular pen and pencil game, also known as Xs and Os. This version of the game is for two players. Players set 'X' or 'O' one after another until one of the players have a straight line (including diagonals). If all cells in a 3x3 field are occupied and no one got a straigft line - it is a tie!  



The code was created using Python 3.8  
If your machine has an installed Python 3, you can run the code in terminal(command line):  
$ python3 tictactoe.py
