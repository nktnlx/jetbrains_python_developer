This is the 6th project completed by me from [JetBrains Python Developer track.](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/2)

Coffee Machine -- the project emulates an operation of a coffee machine. During the project I've practiced working with functions, loops and conditions. Also there was an intro to OOP, including: classes, instances, methods, attributes and magic methods.   

An example of the script execution:  
```
Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
remaining

The coffee machine has:
400 of water
540 of milk
120 of coffee beans
9 of disposable cups
$550 of money

Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
buy  
What do you want to buy? 1 - espresso, 2 - latte, 3 - cappuccino, back - to main menu:
2
I have enough resources, making you a coffee!

Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
buy
What do you want to buy? 1 - espresso, 2 - latte, 3 - cappuccino, back - to main menu:
2
Sorry, not enough water!

Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
fill
Write how many ml of water do you want to add:
1000
Write how many ml of milk do you want to add:
0
Write how many grams of coffee beans do you want to add:
0
Write how many disposable cups of coffee do you want to add:
0

Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
buy 
What do you want to buy? 1 - espresso, 2 - latte, 3 - cappuccino, back - to main menu:
2
I have enough resources, making you a coffee!

Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
take
I gave you $564

Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
remaining

The coffee machine has:
700 of water
390 of milk
80 of coffee beans
7 of disposable cups
$0 of money

Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
buy 
What do you want to buy? 1 - espresso, 2 - latte, 3 - cappuccino, back - to main menu:
3
I have enough resources, making you a coffee!

Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
remaining

The coffee machine has:
500 of water
290 of milk
68 of coffee beans
6 of disposable cups
$6 of money

Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
exit

```


The code was created using Python 3.8  
If your machine has an installed Python 3, you can run the code in terminal(command line):  
$ python3 coffee_machine.py
