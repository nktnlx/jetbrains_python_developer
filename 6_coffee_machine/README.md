This is the forth project completed by me from [JetBrains Python Developer track.](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/2)

Coffee Machine -- the project emulates an operation of a coffee machine. During the project I've practiced working with functions, loops and conditions. Also there was an intro to OOP, including: classes, instances, methods, attributes and magic methods.   

An example of the script execution:  
```
Write how many ml of water the coffee machine has:
1500
Write how many ml of milk the coffee machine has:
300
Write how many grams of coffee beans the coffee machine has:
115
Write how many cups of coffee you will need:
5
Yes, I can make that amount of coffee (and even 1 more than that)

```


The code was created using Python 3.8  
If your machine has an installed Python 3, you can run the code in terminal(command line):  
$ python3 coffee_machine.py
