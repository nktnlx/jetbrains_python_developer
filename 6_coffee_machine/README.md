This is the forth project completed by me from [JetBrains Python Developer track.](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/2)

Coffee Machine -- the project emulates an operation of a coffee machine. During the project I've practiced working with functions, loops and conditions. Also there was an intro to OOP, including: classes, instances, methods, attributes and magic methods.   

An example of the script execution:  
```
The coffee machine has:
400 of water
540 of milk
120 of coffee beans
9 of disposable cups
550 of money

Write action (buy, fill, take):
buy
What do you want to buy? 1 - espresso, 2 - latte, 3 - cappuccino:
3

The coffee machine has:
200 of water
440 of milk
108 of coffee beans
8 of disposable cups
556 of money
```


The code was created using Python 3.8  
If your machine has an installed Python 3, you can run the code in terminal(command line):  
$ python3 coffee_machine.py
