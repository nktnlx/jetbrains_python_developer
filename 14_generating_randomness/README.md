This is the 2nd project completed by me from [JetBrains Natural Language Processing track.](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/10)

Generating Randomness -- Everyone knows that people are bad at generating random things. In this project, we will check this assumption using a small program that will predict "random" user actions. This project will teach you to work with dictionaries and lists, as well as with simple predictive models.   

An example of the script execution:  
```
Print a random string containing 0 or 1:

> 01000111001
Current data length is 11, 9 symbols left
Print a random string containing 0 or 1:

> 2345
Current data length is 11, 9 symbols left
Print a random string containing 0 or 1:

> 1010456
Current data length is 15, 5 symbols left
Print a random string containing 0 or 1:

> 0100010

Final data string:
0100011100110100100010
```  

The code was created using Python 3.8  
If your machine has an installed Python 3, you can run the code in terminal(command line):  
$ python3 randomness_gen.py
