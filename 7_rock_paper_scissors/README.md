This is the forth project completed by me from [JetBrains Python Developer track.](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/2)

rock_paper_scissors -- a playable Rock-Paper-Scissors game, with a Player vs Computer mode. Practiced use of arrays, the Random library, formatted strings, and algorithms.   

An example of the script execution:  
```
paper
Sorry, but the computer chose scissors

rock
There is a draw (rock)

scissors
Well done. The computer chose paper and failed
```


The code was created using Python 3.8  
If your machine has an installed Python 3, you can run the code in terminal(command line):  
$ python3 game.py
