This is the 10th project completed by me from [JetBrains Python Developer track.](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/2)

To-Do List -- To-Do list that will help you manage your tasks. Practiced loops, conditions and statements. Also learned the basics of SQLAlchemy to manage SQLite database on Python. The project was built using OOP.
